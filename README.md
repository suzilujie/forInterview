# Improvement points
## Below code appended to my_greeter_test.py for correct importing my_greeter.py
```
...
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src')))

from my_greeter import MyGreeter
...
```

## Add new layer to Dockerfile for installing 'make' tool in container
```
...
RUN apk add build-base 
...
```

# The 'make dev-tests' can be exec correctly in my dev-environment
```
PS C:\Users\ds-recruit-main\python> make dev-tests
